# k8-go-api

- Go package that connects with ICAP server that recieves an infected file and rebuild it using its content.
- It uses [comm package](https://github.com/k8-proxy/k8-go-comm) that wraps MinIO and RabbitMQ together.

### Steps of processing

- User request with file.
- The endpoint uploads the file to MinIO and returns a URL.
- The endpoint publishes a message to RabbitMQ queue that contains URL and header info like source language and target.
- The translation processing ( mimic processing pod ) consumes the message and download file from MinIO and translate it and then upload it to MinIO and get a URL.
- Then publish the translated file URL to the queue.
- Our API consumes the message that contains URL to the translated file and download it and write it to the HTTP response.

## Build

- Clone the repo.
- Rename/copy .env.example file to .env
- Modify .env file according to your needs.
- Open the terminal in your current directory then run:

```
cd k8-go-api
go build -o server ./cmd
./server
```

- For quick start using docker to run containers for RabbitMQ and MinIO.
- Run Standalone MinIO on Docker.

```
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -e "MINIO_ROOT_USER=<minio_root_user_name>" -e "MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=<minio_root_password>" minio/minio server /data
```

- Run RabbitMQ on Docker.

```
docker run -d --hostname <host_name> --name <container_name> -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3-management

```

The server will start at:

- Local: http://localhost:8100

### Docker build

```
docker build -t k8-go-api .
docker run -it -p 8100:8100 k8-go-api
```

## Test

For testing, run `go test ./...`

## End points:

1- `/api/rebuild/file`<br>
<strong>Method</strong>: POST.<br>
<strong>Description: </strong>This endpoint accepts requests to rebuild a file with Glasswall d-FIRST™ Engine. Both the file and the Content Management Policy are sent in the request body with a 'Content-Type' of 'multipart/form-data'. The Rebuilt file is then returned in the response body with a 'Content-Type' of 'application/octet-stream'.<br>

2- `/api/rebuild/base64`<br>
<strong>Method</strong> POST.<br>
<strong>Description: </strong>This endpoint accepts requests to rebuild a file with Glasswall d-FIRST™ Engine. The request body contains the Base64 representation of the file and Glasswall Content Management Flags with a 'Content-Type' of 'application/json'. A Base64 Representation of the rebuilt file is then returned in the response with a 'Content-Type' of 'text/plain'.<br>

Select a file below to copy its Base64 Encoded representation to clipboard. The Total supported request size of the API gateway is 6MB, therefore the base64 encoded string must also be less than 6MB.<br>

3- `/api/rebuild/zip`<br>
<strong>Method</strong>: POST.<br>
<strong>Description: </strong>This endpoint accepts requests to rebuild a zip file with Glasswall d-FIRST™ Engine. Both the file and the Content Management Policy are sent in the request body with a 'Content-Type' of 'multipart/form-data'. The Rebuilt file is then returned in the response body with a 'Content-Type' of 'application/octet-stream'.
